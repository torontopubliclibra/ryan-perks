        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>I’m a professional editor and proofreader who combines a background in graduate-level writing and research with more than a decade of experience working with some of the leading publishers in North America and the UK. Specializing in the humanities and social sciences, I’ve edited hundreds of published books and collaborated with award-winning authors at all stages of their careers and on virtually every type of project, from scholarly monographs (history, sociology, ethnography, literary studies, economics) and general-interest books for popular audiences (memoir, reportage, travel writing, narrative history, and even a few novels) to market and technical reports (on green finance, cleantech, the platform economy, and more).</p>
        <p>I took my first, tentative steps into publishing in the early 2010s while finishing a master’s degree in history and working part-time as a freelance writer. Having long planned on pursuing a PhD, I was surprised to discover in editing a genuine vocation—one that satisfies my wide-ranging curiosity in a wealth of different subject areas and allows me to collaborate with interesting and creative people. I pride myself on matching scholarly rigor and attention to detail with a keen literary sensibility and an understanding of a variety of different fields. Outside of work, I like to read, play music, cook, travel, and spend time with my family.</p>

        <h3>Services</h3>
        <hr/>

        <img src="./assets/placeholder-image.png" class="banner" />

        <p>I provide a full range of editorial services, from copyediting and proofreading to stylistic and developmental editing. I also enjoy working with non-native English authors and academics, with whom I have extensive experience as both an editor and writing consultant.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the project, my aim is to help you arrive at the strongest and most distilled version of your voice as a writer, achieve and maintain credibility with your intended audience, and ensure that your prose is natural, clear, and error-free.</p>

        <h4>Developmental editing</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Addressing big-picture issues at the level of content and structure to ensure your book is both logically and formally sound; determining the most effective order of presentation so that successive chapters build on each other and contribute to the book’s core goals; and choosing the type and extent of sourcing appropriate to your particular project.</p>

        <h4>Stylistic/line editing</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Similar in many ways to copyediting, but focusing more closely on the writing, ensuring fluidity, greater clarity of expression, and cogency of argument; identifying and eliminating gaps in logic; and rewriting where necessary to achieve a presentation that strikes a balance between idiomatic and authoritative.</p>

        <h4>Copyediting</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Addressing a mix of mechanical issues—grammar, punctuation, and spelling; consistent treatment of numbers and internal cross-references; proper formatting of citations and illustrations—and more substantive things like eliminating repetition and adding linguistic variety, ensuring consistency and accuracy, some limited fact-checking, etc.</p>

        <h4>Proofreading</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Distinct from copyediting, this involves reviewing the final text after it has been typeset, making sure that any errors remaining from or inadvertently introduced during previous rounds of work are eliminated and all internal locators and cross-references accurately reflect the final book.</p>

        <h4>Misc. services: Research assistance, interview transcription, book proposals</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">I’m happy to discuss any other projects you might have in mind. Please <a href="#contact"/>get in touch</a> with details.</p>

        <h4>A word about rates</h4>
        <p>My rates are determined on an ad hoc basis and take into account several factors, including level of edit required, nature of the text, requested timeline, etc. <a href="#contact"/>Contact me</a> with a description of your project and the type of work you’d like performed. If I can see a sample passage, I’ll provide a brief edit free of charge and an estimate for the cost of the whole project.</p>

              <p>“Ryan’s editing work on my book manuscript was fantastic. He understood what the book was about and could see how to sharpen the wording to better surface the analysis and make the writing more concise. He also did the detailed cross-checking and copyediting necessary to give it polish. His work process was clear and straightforward, and he always met his deadlines. It was an absolute pleasure working with him.”</p>

              <p>“I was referred to Ryan for revising the English translation of my book, and in turn I now enthusiastically recommend him to my colleagues. Ryan demonstrates exceptional professionalism and a meticulous attention to linguistic precision—an increasingly rare quality in an era when writing is often rushed at the expense of clarity. Thanks to his efforts, I watched my manuscript, originally written in “correct” English, transform into what I would call “authentic” English—writing that is idiomatic, accurate, and fluid. Throughout the process, Ryan collaborated with me as a true partner in revision. He frequently consulted me with thoughtful and precise questions to ensure he fully understood my intent. In many cases, his questions were so perceptive that they prompted me to further refine my own ideas. I would also add that Ryan is courteous and personable, making him a pleasure to work with.”</p>

My book was studded with complex archival references, and there are few people who could have steered me through their formal documentation with as much assurance as Ryan did. He is one of the very best copyeditors with whom it has been my privilege to work (and working with Cambridge University Press in the past, I have had some good ones). He is always prompt, thorough, attentive, thoughtful, well-informed, and very smart. I highly recommend him.”</p>

The book manuscript was challenging, incorporating texts and references to print and archival material in three different languages. It is always surprising to see how many errors remain in a manuscript in the final stretch of production, after multiple verifications by so many readers. Ryan noticed missing words, grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and inconsistent capitalizations. He also flagged style issues while always taking care to maintain my voice. I really enjoyed collaborating with him, and was especially grateful for his professionalism and eagle eye at such a critical point in the publication process. After Ryan's corrections, I felt much more confident about seeing my monograph arrive in the world.”</p>
