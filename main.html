        <h3>About</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>I’m a professional editor and proofreader who combines a background in graduate-level writing and research with more than a decade of experience working with some of the leading publishers in North America and the UK. Specializing in the humanities and social sciences, I’ve edited hundreds of published books and collaborated with award-winning authors at all stages of their careers and on virtually every type of project, from scholarly monographs (history, sociology, ethnography, literary studies, economics) and general-interest books for popular audiences (memoir, reportage, travel writing, narrative history, and even a few novels) to market and technical reports (on green finance, cleantech, the platform economy, and more).</p>
        <p>I took my first, tentative steps into publishing in the early 2010s while finishing a master’s degree in history and working part-time as a freelance writer. Having long planned on pursuing a PhD, I was surprised to discover in editing a genuine vocation—one that satisfies my wide-ranging curiosity in a wealth of different subject areas and allows me to collaborate with interesting and creative people. I pride myself on matching scholarly rigor and attention to detail with a keen literary sensibility and an understanding of a variety of different fields. Outside of work, I like to read, play music, cook, travel, and spend time with my family.</p>

        <h3>Services</h3>
        <hr/>

        <img src="./assets/placeholder-image.png" class="banner" />

        <p>I provide a full range of editorial services, from copyediting and proofreading to stylistic and developmental editing. I also enjoy working with non-native English authors and academics, with whom I have extensive experience as both an editor and writing consultant.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the project, my aim is to help you arrive at the strongest and most distilled version of your voice as a writer, achieve and maintain credibility with your intended audience, and ensure that your prose is natural, clear, and error-free.</p>

        <h4>Developmental editing</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Addressing big-picture issues at the level of content and structure to ensure your book is both logically and formally sound; determining the most effective order of presentation so that successive chapters build on each other and contribute to the book’s core goals; and choosing the type and extent of sourcing appropriate to your particular project.</p>

        <h4>Stylistic/line editing</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Similar in many ways to copyediting, but focusing more closely on the writing, ensuring fluidity, greater clarity of expression, and cogency of argument; identifying and eliminating gaps in logic; and rewriting where necessary to achieve a presentation that strikes a balance between idiomatic and authoritative.</p>

        <h4>Copyediting</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Addressing a mix of mechanical issues—grammar, punctuation, and spelling; consistent treatment of numbers and internal cross-references; proper formatting of citations and illustrations—and more substantive things like eliminating repetition and adding linguistic variety, ensuring consistency and accuracy, some limited fact-checking, etc.</p>

        <h4>Proofreading</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">Distinct from copyediting, this involves reviewing the final text after it has been typeset, making sure that any errors remaining from or inadvertently introduced during previous rounds of work are eliminated and all internal locators and cross-references accurately reflect the final book.</p>

        <h4>Misc. services: Research assistance, interview transcription, book proposals</h4>
        <p class="services-bullet">I’m happy to discuss any other projects you might have in mind. Please <a href="#contact"/>get in touch</a> with details.</p>

        <h4>A word about rates</h4>
        <p>My rates are determined on an ad hoc basis and take into account several factors, including level of edit required, nature of the text, requested timeline, etc. <a href="#contact"/>Contact me</a> with a description of your project and the type of work you’d like performed. If I can see a sample passage, I’ll provide a brief edit free of charge and an estimate for the cost of the whole project.</p>

        <h3>Testimonials</h3>
        <hr/>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Ryan’s editing work on my book manuscript was fantastic. He understood what the book was about and could see how to sharpen the wording to better surface the analysis and make the writing more concise. He also did the detailed cross-checking and copyediting necessary to give it polish. His work process was clear and straightforward, and he always met his deadlines. It was an absolute pleasure working with him.”</p>
          <cite>— Joshua Barker, author of <span class="title">State of Fear: Policing a Postcolonial City</span> (Duke University Press)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“Our collaboration was for me a pure delight. Ryan was a pleasure to work with and never missed a deadline. Even though our stylistic instincts are different, it was not hard to find common ground, and his contribution unquestionably made the text a better read.”</p>
          <cite>— David Beatty, author of <span class="title">Faith, Force, and Reason: An Armchair History of the Rule of Law</span> (University of Toronto Press)</cite>
